                completly oblivious to competent in a field. This summer, I taught myself react.js, css, amazon lamda functions just to make this website.
                I am in my last year at the University of Edinburgh studying computer science and artifical intelligence and on track for a 1st.
                My degree has extensively covered java, python,haskell,algorithms, and machine learning but has also thrown me in to high intensity team oriented environments.
                Working in a team for one of my final projects came with it's challenges but it is so enjoyable. I have found I thrive in a team and I am very suited to 
                team-based objectives and goals. </p>
